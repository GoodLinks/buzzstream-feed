# BuzzStream Feed

Show your activity feed to clients or to the world.

BuzzStream Feed is brought to you by <a href="http://goodlinks.io">GoodLinks - The Content Outreach Service</a>

## Overview

BuzzStream Feed pulls your activity out of your BuzzStream account in order to share it with others.  There are two primary modes that it can be used for:

1. For the World - Show your activity to the world with personal data fully scrubbed.  All they can see is the reputation level and relationship status of the people you're reaching out to.
2. For Clients - Show clients your outreach activity.  They can see the names / subject lines / dates, but they can't see contents of the emails for privacy reasons.
